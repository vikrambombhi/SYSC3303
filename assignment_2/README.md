### How to compile
The program should all already be compiled, you can find the binaries in the `build` directroy.
Follow these steps if you want to recompile the program.

1. Open a terminal (powershell if on windows)
2. Change directory to the project `cd /path/to/assignment`
3. Compile the programs with `make`

### How to run
##### Windows/Linux/MacOS
1. Open 1 terminal (powershell if on windows)
2. Navigate to the build folder with `cd /path/to/assignment` in the terminals
3. Run the program in the terminal with `java -jar assignment_2.jar`

### Notes
1. The sequence diagram makes one sandwich and then exits
2. My class Assemble is basically the Kitchen class from the grading rubric
